# Algorithm notes:
#
# The ingredients are shown in the diagram below:
#
#      #1 -----X----------X--X------------------X---X------)----->
#
#           #2 ------X--------------X------X-X------------X)---X-X---->
#
# #3 ----X------X---------x--------------x)----------------->
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------> t
#
#
# "X" = an event.  Each event has a unique discrete time associated with
# it.  Physically the event might represent a signal lasting many tens
# of minutes, but regardless of that we require a "time" to be assigned to
# that signal, and that time will form the basis of the coincidence test.
#
# "#1", etc. = a detector that provides a sequence of events.  Each
# detector has a time offset applied to its events
#
# ")" = t_complete for that detector.  Calling code guarantees that the
# event sequence for that detector is complete up to (not necessarily
# including) this time.  Events might already have been collected at or
# following this time, but no further events will be collected preceding
# that time.  In the diagram above the event lists are shown displaced
# according to their respective offsets, and the t_completes shifted
# accordingly.
#
# For each pair of detectors there is a coincidence window which is assumed
# to equal some fixed time interval common to all detector pairs + the
# light travel time between that pair.  Two events are coincident if their
# times differ by no more than the coincidence window for their respective
# detector pair.  three or more events are coincident if all pairs of
# events within the n-tuple are coincident.
#
# Looking at the events again:
#
#      #1 -----X----------X--X------------------X---X------)----->
#
#           #2 ------X--------------X------X-X------------X)---X-X---->
#
# #3 ----X------X---------x--------------x)----------------->
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------> t
#                                         ^                ^
#                                         B                A
#
# The event list for detector #2 is complete up to
#
# t = t_complete(#2) + offset(#2) = A,
#
# and if we were only concerned about single-detector candidates from
# detector #2 then we could scan up to that time and report everything that
# we find and know that we had found all such candidates without omissions
# or double-counting any.  However, that last event in detector #2, for
# example, just before that detector's t_complete, might later be found to
# be coincident with something from detector #3, whose event list at this
# time is still only complete up to
#
# t = t_complete(#3) + offset(#3) = B
#
# Likewise, #1+#2 doubles can only be constructed up to approximately t =
# B because they might actually be found to form triples once the event
# list for detector #3 is filled in.
#
# We need to determine which candidates or potential candidates we have
# sufficiently complete information about to determine if they form a
# coincident n-tuple;  and, after that, which events can be disposed of
# because all possible n-tuple candidates that can be constructed from them
# have been constructed (or, equivalently, which events to retain because
# we have not yet been able to decide all the candidates they might
# participate in);  and, additionally, we need to do this in a way that
# upon repeated applications of this process no candidate or part thereof
# is reported more than once and no candidate that can be constructed from
# the (complete) event sequences is missed.
#
# The algorithm we use for achieving this is the following.  We need the
# following ingredients:
#
# - an exactly reproducible method by which to assign a "time" to an
# n-tuple candidate so that two different codes (possibly using different
# arithmetic optimiziations, or the same code doing the calculation a
# second time) will agree whether a given candidate is before or after (or
# at) some given time boundary;
#
# - given that definition, a method by which to determine the latest such
# time up to which all possible candidates can be constructed;
#
# - a method by which to determine which events can no longer participate
# in candidates on subsequent invocations of the algorithm.
#
# In particular, we need these to act together so that the decision as to
# whether or not a candidate is before or after the time bound we choose is
# stable against the addition of new events to the queues (the bound must
# precede the times up to which event lists are complete by a sufficent
# margin), and we will need to retain events long enough to make this
# definition stable against removal of events from the queues at least
# until the risk of mistaking subsets of the n-tuple as new candidates has
# passed.  It is desirable for the algorithm to achieve the lowest possible
# latency, meaning always reporting as many candidates as can be decided
# given the information available, but performance is the primary
# consideration so we also require an algorithm that can make decisions
# about candidates very quickly without using much memory.  For example,
# comparing every potential candidate against a list of everything that has
# previously been reported is impractical.
#
# We will define the "time" of an n-tuple candidate to be the earliest time
# of the events in the candidate with their respective offsets applied.
# For n-tuple candidates whoses "times" precede the time up to which all
# detectors' event lists are complete this is stable against addition of
# new events to the detector queues, even for those candidates that are
# modified by the addition of extra coincident events as the event
# sequences are advanced.
#
# Looking at our event sequences from above again, we now identify 6 times
# of interest:
#
#      #1 -----O---|----|-X--X--|----|----|-|---X---X------)----->
#                  |    |       |    |    | |
#           #2 ----|-X--|-------|---X|----|X|X------------X)---X-X---->
#                  |    |       |    |    | |
# #3 ----O------O--|----|-x-----|----|---x)-|--------------->
# -----------------|----[=======|====)----|-|---------------------------> t
#                  A    B       C    D    E F
#
# E is the earliest of the time-shifted t_compeletes, in this case it
# corresponds to #3's time-shifted t_complete.  D is the closest
# time-shifted time an event in another detector can have to E before we
# cannot say if it forms a coincidence with events in #3 that we have not
# yet collected.  Since the #3's event list is complete upto but not
# including E, we can collect all n-tuples whose time (time of earliest
# candidate) is upto but not including D.  B was the boundary upto
# which we collected candidates in the previous iteration.  Since at that
# time we did not allow candidates whose time was exactly B to be
# collected, we now include them.  Therefore the range of candidate times
# to be collected is [B, D) (closed from below, open from above).  In order
# to know that an n-tuple's earliest coincident member is not prior to B
# (and therefore it would have already been reported as part of a larger
# coincidence involving that event) we must retain and include for
# consideration events as early as A.  A precedes B by the largest
# coincidence window between any pair of detectors.  In this iteration, any
# events that had preceded A have been disposed of (and are indicated now
# as an "O").  After this iteration is complete, we will have reported
# exactly all candidates who canonical times fall in [B, D) and they will
# not be reported again, but for the same reason we retained events between
# A and B we must not discard all of them yet.  We must retain all the
# events whose time-shifted times are C or later where C precedes D by the
# largest coincidence window between any pair of detectors.  Since we are
# only forming coincidences involving at least one event preceding D, we do
# not need to include in the coincidence analysis at this iteration any of
# the events whose time-sifted times are F or later, where F antecedes
# D by the largest coincidence window between any pair of detectors.
#
# The procedure is to (i) compute these boundary times, (ii) collect all
# the events from all detectors upto but not including F, (iii) perform a
# full coincidence analysis, (iv) report as newly-identified any candidates
# whose canonical times fall in the interval [B, D), ignoring the rest, (v)
# then discard all events up to C, (vi) record D to be used as B next time,
# (vii) and return.
#
# There is an additional complication.  One of the problems we need to
# solve is to provide the set of single-detector events that participate in
# the n-tuple candidates, across all time-shift offset vectors.  For
# example, we need a list of the detector #1 events that participate in any
# n-tuple candidate, but we need each one to be listed only once,
# regardless of how many different offset vectors were found to result in
# it participating in an n-tuple candidate.
#
# We solve this problem the following way.  We maintain a set of the events
# that have participated in n-tuple coincidences.  The first time an event
# is found to participate in an n-tuple candidate it is added to the set
# and reported as a newly used single-detector event to be inserted into
# the calling code's output document.  Events that participate in n-tuple
# coincidences but are found to already be in that set are not reported to
# the calling code (the n-tuple coincidence is, but not the single-detector
# event).  To prevent the set from growing without bound, causing both memory
# and performance problems, events are removed from the set when they are
# removed from the last queue that contains them.
#
# How to compute the times.  For each time slide,
#
# - D is the minimum across all instruments of
#
# D = min(t_complete + offset - max(coincidence window with other detectors))
#
# Note that this is slightly different than the algorithm described above,
# where we explained that D was computed relative to E, the minimum of the
# time-shifted completes.  In fact we compute the boundary uniquely for
# each detector and take the minimum of those.  This is simpler, but also
# is necessary in the event that two detectors' t_completes are very close
# and the later one has a larger maximum coincidence window than the
# earlier one, larger by an amount greater than the difference between the
# t_completes.
#
# - B is this value computed in the previous iteration.
#
# - F is computed as a unique value for each detector as
#
# F = D + max(coincidence window with other detectors)
#
# For simplicity, the description above implied F was common to all
# detectors, but we can reduce the computational cost by trimming it
# as tightly as we can for each detector.
#
# - likewise, A is computed as a unique value for each detector as
#
# A = B - max(coincidence window with other detectors)
#
# - and C, also, is computed as a unique value for each detector as
#
# C = D - max(coincidence window with other detectors)
#
# For each detector, all events in the interval [A, F) for that detector
# are collected and fed into the coincidence constructor.  When finished,
# all events upto but not including C are discarded and reported to the
# top-level of the coincidence engine as being no-longer in storage, which
# is information it uses to manage the set of events that have participated
# in n-tuple coincidences.
#
#
# Some pipelines require a list of the events known to not form
# coincidences.  This information might be used, for example, to assist in
# construting noise models for false-alarm probability estimation.
# Therefore, in addition to constructing n-tuple coincs we also construct a
# stream of non-coincident single-detector events (which might also be
# reported as n-tuple candidates if n is 1).  This is achieved by
# maintainingg a set of all events that participate in (n>=2)-tuple coincs,
# and then at the point where events are flushed from the queues any that
# are not found in that set are reported in the "non-coincident event"
# stream.  Any that are found in the set as they are being flushed are at
# that time removed from the set to keep it from growing.
#
# Implementation Notes:
#
# The snglesqueue, coincgen_doubles, and the TimeSlideGraphNode object
# export APIs that are partially compatible with each other.  This is done
# so that they can be used interchangably within the time slide graph to
# implement coincidence generators of different orders without the need to
# wrap them in conditionals to select the correct code path.  This is why,
# for example, the concept of the coincidence window and the distinction
# between t_complete and t_coinc_complete have been pushed down into the
# snglesqueue object even though they seem to be nonsensical there.

		coinc_sieve(), if supplied, must be a callable object with
		the signature

			coinc_sieve(events, offset_vector)

		If the return value is False the event tuple is reported to
		the calling code, otherwise it is discarded.  The default
		is to report all n-tuples.  This feature can be used to
		remove obviously uninteresting candidates from the reported
		candidate stream, to reduce the memory requirements of the
		calling code and the disk requirements of output documents.

		The optional parameters newly_reported, flushed, and
		flushed_unused may be used to pass lists to this code,
		which will be populated with additional information to
		assist the calling code.  If lists are supplied, their
		contents will be erased and populated with event objects as
		follows:

		newly_reported:  list of single-detector events that have
		participated in n-tuple candidates reported to the calling
		code for the first time this invocation of .pull().  Note
		that only those events that particate in n-tuples that
		survive the optional coinc_sieve() test are included.  This
		is meant to allow the calling code to populate an event
		table with the list of just the events needed to describe
		the surviving n-tuple candidates.

		flushed:  list of single-detector events that have been
		removed from the internal queues because they are now
		sufficiently old that all n-tuples that they can
		participate in have been formed and reported.  This can be
		used to assist the calling code with house keeping tasks,
		for example emptying its event_collector implementation of
		unnecessary internal state.

		flushed_unused:  list of the single-detector events in the
		flushed list that never participated in an n-tuple
		candidate.  Note that events are considered to have
		participated in an n-tuple candidate if the coincidence
		engine reported them in one, regardless of whether or not
		the optional coinc_sieve() test ultimately rejected the
		candidate before it was reported to the calling code.

		NOTE:  the intent of the coinc_sieve() feature is not to
		alter the definition of the coincidence test, but merely
		reduce the data volume going into the output document.
		Therefore, the coinc_sieve() feature affects the events
		appearing in the newly_reported list because that list is
		expected to be used to construct the output document, but
		does not affect the events appearing in the flushed_unused
		list because that list is meant to convey information about
		which events failed to form coincidenes, for example for
		the purpose of informing false-alarm probability noise
		models.

class LnLikelihoodRatioMixin(object):
	"""
	Mixin to assist in implementing a log likelihood ratio ranking
	statistic class.  The ranking statistic class that inherits from
	this must:  (i) define a callable .numerator attribute that returns
	ln P(*args, **kwargs | signal);  (ii) define a callable
	.denominator attribute that returns ln P(*args, **kwargs | noise).

	Inheriting from this will:

	1.  Add a .__call__() method that returns the natural logarithm of
	the likelihood ratio

	ln P(*args, **kwargs | signal) - ln P(*args, **kwargs | noise)

	The implementation handles various special cases sensibly, such as
	when either or both of the logarithms of the numerator and
	denominator diverge.

	2.  Add a .ln_lr_samples() method that makes use of the .numerator
	and .denominator attributes, together with the .__call__() method
	to transform a sequence of (*args, **kwargs) into a sequence of log
	likelihood ratios and their respective relative frequencies.  This
	can be used to construct histograms of P(ln L | signal) and P(ln L
	| noise).  These distributions are required for, for example,
	signal rate estimation and false-alarm probability estimation.

	Why is the likelihood ratio useful?  Starting from Bayes' theorem,
	and using the fact that "signal" and "noise" are the only two
	choices:

	                   P(data | signal) * P(signal)
	P(signal | data) = ----------------------------
	                              P(data)

	                  P(data | signal) * P(signal)
	  = ---------------------------------------------------------
	    P(data | noise) * P(noise) + P(data | signal) * P(signal)

	            [P(data | signal) / P(data | noise)] * P(signal)
	  = ----------------------------------------------------------------
	    1 - P(signal) + [P(data | signal) / P(data | noise)] * P(signal)

	                        Lambda * P(signal)
	P(signal | data) = ----------------------------
	                   1 + (Lambda - 1) * P(signal)

	               P(data | signal)
	where Lambda = ----------------
	               P(data | noise)

	Differentiating P(signal | data) w.r.t. Lambda shows the derivative
	is always positive, so the probability that a candidate is the
	result of a gravitiational wave is a monotonically increasing
	function of the likelihood ratio.  Ranking events from "most likely
	to be a genuine signal" to "least likely to be a genuine signal"
	can be performed by sorting candidates by likelihood ratio.  Or, if
	one wanted to set a threshold on P(signal | data) to select a
	subset of candidates such that the candidates selected have a given
	purity (the fraction of them that are real is fixed), that is
	equivalent to selecting candidates using a likelihood ratio
	threshold.

	These are expressions of the Neyman-Pearson lemma which tells us
	that thresholding on Lambda creates a detector that extremizes the
	detection efficiency at fixed false-alarm rate.

		self and the return value is computed from the results.

		NOTE:  sub-classes may override this method, possibly

		mechanism does not require this method to return exactly
		the natural logarithm of the .numerator/.denominator ratio.
		The .ln_lr_samples() mechanism does not assume the

		Generator that transforms a sequence of candidate parameter
		samples into a sequence of log likelihood ratio samples.

		random_params_seq is a sequence (generator is OK) yielding
		3-element tuples whose first two elements provide the *args
		and **kwargs values to be passed to the .numerator and
		.denominator functions, and whose third element is the
		natural logarithm of the probability density from which the
		(*args, **kwargs) parameters have been drawn evaluated at
		those parameters.

		The output of this generator is a sequence of 3-element
		tuples, each of whose elements are:

		1.  a value of the natural logarithm of the likelihood
		ratio,

		2.  the natural logarithm of the relative frequency of
		occurance of that likelihood ratio in the signal population
		corrected for the relative frequency at which the
		random_params_seq sampler is causing that value to be
		returned, and

		3.  the natural logarithm of the relative frequency of
		occurance of that likelihood ratio in the noise population
		similarly corrected for the relative frequency at which the
		random_params_seq sampler is causing that value to be
		returned.

		The intention is for the first element of each tuple to be
		added to histograms using the two relative frequencies as
		weights, i.e., the two relative frequencies give the number
		of times one should consider this one draw of log
		likelihood ratio to have occured in the two populations.

		On each iteration, the *args and **kwargs values yielded by
		random_params_seq are passed to our own .__call__() method
		to evalute the log likelihood ratio at that choice of
		parameter values.  The parameters are also passed to the
		.__call__() mehods of our own .numerator and .denominator
		attributes to obtain the signal and noise population
		densities at those parameters.

		If signal_noise_pdfs is not None then, instead of using our
		own .numerator and .denominator attributes, the parameters
		are passed to the .__call__() methods of its .numerator and
		.denominator attributes to obtain those densities.  This
		allows the distribution of ranking statistic values
		obtained from alternative signal and noise populations to
		be modelled.  This is sometimes useful for diagnostic
		purposes.

		Normalizations:

		Within the context of the intended application, it is
		sufficient for all of the probabilities involved (the
		.numerator and .denominator probability densities, and the
		probability density supplied by the random_params_seq
		geneator) to be correct up to unknown normalization
		constants, i.e., the natural logarithms of the probabilties
		to be correct up to unknown additive constants.  That is
		why the two probability densities yielded by each iteration
		of this generator are described as relative frequencies:
		the ratios among their values are meaningful, but not their
		absolute values.

		If all of the supplied probabilities are, in fact, properly
		normalized, then the relative frequencies returned by this
		generator are, also, correctly normalized probability
		densities.
