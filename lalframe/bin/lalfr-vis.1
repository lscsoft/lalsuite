.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBlalfr-vis\fP utility reads a requested interval
[\fItstart\fP,\fItstart\fP+\fIdeltat\fP)
of \fIchannel\fP data from frame files that are either indexed
in the \fIcachefile\fP or matching the pattern \fIglobstring\fP as
described by glob(3).
The output is written to \fIoutfile\fP and the
format of the output is determined by extension of \fIoutfile\fP
as described below.
If \fIoutfile\fP is not specified, the output is written to the
standard output in two-column ascii format data.

The \fBlalfr-vis\fP can optionally perform certain manipulations of
the data that is read, including:
.IP o
High-pass filtering of the data.
.IP o
Low-pass filtering of the data.
.IP o
Resampling of the data.
.IP o
Computing the power spectrum of the data.
.PP
If any of the filtering or resampling operations are performed, it is
recommended additional \fIpadding\fP is used.  This additional data,
before and after the requested interval, will be discarded before output (or
before computing the power spectrum) which will remove filter transients.
Note that data will be read for the entire interval
[\fItstart\fP-\fIpadding\fP,\fItstart\fP+\fIdeltat\fP+\fIpadding\fP)
and must be available.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-h\fP, \fB--help
Prints the help message.
.TP
\fB-c\fP \fIchannel\fP, \fB--channel\fP=\fIchannel\fP
The \fIchannel\fP name that is to be read.
.TP
\fB-f\fP \fIcachefile\fP, \fB--frame-cache\fP=\fIcachefile\fP
The \fIcachefile\fP indexing the frame files to be used.
.TP
\fB-f\fP \fIglobstring\fP, \fB--frame-cache\fP=\fIglobstring\fP
The \fIcachefile\fP indexing the frame files to be used.
.TP
\fB-o\fP \fIoutfile\fP, \fB--output\fP=\fIoutfile\fP
The \fIoutfile\fP to use.  The extension of \fIoutfile\fP is used to
determine the format of the output.  The output formats are described below.
.TP
\fB-s\fP \fItstart\fP, \fB--start-time\fP=\fItstart\fP
The time \fItstart\fP GPS seconds of the data to read.  If padding
is specified with the \fB-P\fP option or the \fB--pad\fP option, an additional
amount of data preceding \fItstart\fP is also read, and discarded after
any requested filtering of the data is complete.
.TP
\fB-t\fP \fIdeltat\fP, \fB--duration\fP=\fIdeltat\fP
The duration \fIdeltat\fP in seconds of data to read.  If padding
is specified with the \fB-P\fP option or the \fB--pad\fP option, an additional
amount of data is also read, and discarded after any requested filtering of
the data is complete.
.TP
\fB-H\fP \fIminfreq\fP, \fB--highpass\fP=\fIminfreq\fP
High-pass filter the data at \fIminfreq\fP Hertz.
An additional amount of data, which will be discarded after the filtering,
should be specified with the \fB-P\fP option or the \fB--pad\fP option to
remove filter transients.
.TP
\fB-L\fP \fImaxfreq\fP, \fB--lowpass\fP=\fImaxfreq\fP
Low-pass filter the data at \fIminfreq\fP Hertz.
An additional amount of data, which will be discarded after the filtering,
should be specified with the \fB-P\fP option or the \fB--pad\fP option to
remove filter transients.
.TP
\fB-P\fP \fIpadding\fP, \fB--pad\fP=\fIpadding\fP
Read \fIpadding\fP additional seconds of data before and after the requested
interval.  This data is then dropped after all requested filtering has been
performed in order to remove filter transients.
.TP
\fB-R\fP \fIsrate\fP, \fB--resample\fP=\fIsrate\fP
Resample the data to sampling rate \fIsrate\fP Hertz.
An additional amount of data, which will be discarded after the filtering,
should be specified with the \fB-P\fP option or the \fB--pad\fP option to
remove filter transients.
.TP
\fB-S\fP \fIresolution\fP, \fB--spectrum\fP=\fIresolution\fP
Compute the power spectrum of the data at the requested \fIresolution\fP
in Hertz.  Depending on the output format, either the amplitude spectral
density or the power spectral density is output.

.SH OUTPUT FORMATS
If the \fB-o\fP or \fB--output\fP option is used to specify an output
file, the extension of that file is used to determine the output format.
Supported output formats include:
.IP .au
Au audio file format.
This format is for time-series data only and may
not be used if the \fB-S\fP or the \fB--spectrum\fP option is used.
.IP .eps
Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) graphical file format.
A plot of the data values as a function of time is produced using the
gnuplot(1) program, if available.
If the \fB-S\fP or the \fB--spectrum\fP option is used, a log-log plot
of the amplitude spectrum is produced instead.
.IP .gif
Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) graphical file format.
A plot of the data values as a function of time is produced using the
gnuplot(1) program, if available.
If the \fB-S\fP or the \fB--spectrum\fP option is used, a log-log plot
of the amplitude spectrum is produced instead.
.IP .jpg
JPEG graphical file format.
A plot of the data values as a function of time is produced using the
gnuplot(1) program, if available.
If the \fB-S\fP or the \fB--spectrum\fP option is used, a log-log plot
of the amplitude spectrum is produced instead.
.IP .pdf
Portable Document Format (PDF) graphical file format.
A plot of the data values as a function of time is produced using the
gnuplot(1) program, if available.
If the \fB-S\fP or the \fB--spectrum\fP option is used, a log-log plot
of the amplitude spectrum is produced instead.
.IP .png
Portable Network Graphics (PNG) graphical file format.
A plot of the data values as a function of time is produced using the
gnuplot(1) program, if available.
If the \fB-S\fP or the \fB--spectrum\fP option is used, a log-log plot
of the amplitude spectrum is produced instead.
.IP .ps
PostScript (PS) graphical file format.
A plot of the data values as a function of time is produced using the
gnuplot(1) program, if available.
If the \fB-S\fP or the \fB--spectrum\fP option is used, a log-log plot
of the amplitude spectrum is produced instead.
.IP .svg
Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) graphical file format.
A plot of the data values as a function of time is produced using the
gnuplot(1) program, if available.
If the \fB-S\fP or the \fB--spectrum\fP optione used, a log-log plot
of the amplitude spectrum is produced instead.
.IP .wav
Waveform Audio File Format (WAVE) audio file format.
This format is for time-series data only and may
not be used if the \fB-S\fP or the \fB--spectrum\fP option is used.
.IP .xml
XML-based LIGO-lightweight (LIGOLw) file format.
If the \fB-S\fP or the \fB--spectrum\fP option is used, the power
spectral density data is written to the file.
.PP
If none of these extensions are used then the output will be in
two-column ascii format.  The first column will be the GPS time of
each sample of data and the second column will be the sample values.
However, if the \fB-S\fP or the \fB--spectrum\fP option is used,
the first column will be the frequency of each sample of the
spectrum and the second column will be the value of the power spectral
density at that frequency.


.SH ENVIRONMENT
The LAL_DEBUG_LEVEL can used to control the error and warning reporting
of \fBlalfr-vis\fP.  Common values are:
LAL_DEBUG_LEVEL=0 which suppresses error messages,
LAL_DEBUG_LEVEL=1 which prints error messages alone,
LAL_DEBUG_LEVEL=3 which prints both error messages and warning messages, and
LAL_DEBUG_LEVEL=7 which additionally prints informational messages.

.SH EXIT STATUS
The \fBlalfr-vis\fP utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
