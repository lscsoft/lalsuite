/**
 * @brief Measures the characteristic signal-to-noise ratio of a gravitational
 * waveform represented in the frequency domain.
 *
 * This routine measures the characteristic signal-to-noise ratio of a signal
 * @p htilde for a detector with a given strain noise power spectral density
 * @p psd.  Only frequency components of the signal between @p f_mim and
 * @p f_max are included in this measurement.  If @p f_min is zero or negative,
 * no lower bound is imposed.  If @p f_max is negative, no upper bound is
 * imposed.
 *
 * The term @e characteristic is used to indicate that this signal-to-noise
 * ratio is the expected value of the signal-to-noise ratio that would be
 * measured for that signal my a perfectly-matched filter in a detector having
 * stationary Gaussian noise with the specified power spectral density.  The
 * signal-to-noise ratio actually recorded by a matched filter is a random
 * variable that depends on the particular instance of the noise.  Thus the
 * @e characteristic signal-to-noise ratio returned by this routine is a
 * property of the signal and the statistical properties of the detector noise.
 *
 * The @e square of the signal-to-noise ratio is given by
 * \f[
 *   (\mbox{signal-to-noise ratio})^2 =
 *   4 \int_{f_{\rm min}}^{f_{\rm max}} \frac{|\tilde{h}(f)|^2}{S_h(f)}\,df
 * \f]
 * where \f$S_h(f)\f$ is the one-sided detector strain noise power spectral
 * density and \f$\tilde{h}(f)\f$ is the Fourier transform of the signal
 * strain time series \f$h(t)\f$
 * \f[
 *   \tilde{h}(f) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty h(t) e^{-2\pi ift}\,dt.
 * \f]
 * The one-sided strain noise power spectral density is defined by
 * \f$\langle\tilde{n}(f)\tilde{n}^\ast(f')\rangle=\frac{1}{2}S_h(|f|)\delta(f-f')\f$
 * where \f$\tilde{n}(f)\f$ is the Fourier transform of the detector noise
 * process \f$n(t)\f$.
 *
 * The discrete versions of these equations are
 * \f[
 *   (\mbox{signal-to-noise ratio})^2 = 4 \Delta f
 *   \sum_{k=k_{\rm min}}^{k_{\rm max}} |\tilde{h}[k]|^2 / S_h[k]
 * \f]
 * where \f$\tilde{h}[k]\f$ for \f$0\le k<N\f$ is the discrete Fourier
 * transform of the discrete time series \f$h[j]=h(j\Delta t)\f$ for
 * \f$0\le j<N\f$:
 * \f[
 *   \tilde{h}[k] = \Delta t \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} h[j] e^{-2\pi ijk/N}
 * \f]
 * (note the factor of \f$\Delta t\f$).  Here \f$\Delta t\f$ is the sampling
 * interval in time, \f$\Delta f=1/(N\Delta t)\f$ is the sampling interval in
 * frequency, and \f$N\f$ is the number of points in the time series.  The
 * discrete one-sided detector strain noise power spectral density is
 * \f$S_h[k]=2\Delta f\langle|\tilde{n}[k]|^2\rangle\f$ where
 * \f$\tilde{n}[k]\f$ is the discrete Fourier transform of the detector noise
 * process \f$n[j]\f$.
 *
 * The limits of the summation are \f$k_{\rm min}=f_{\rm min}/\Delta f\f$ and
 * \f$k_{\rm max}=f_{\rm max}/\Delta f\f$, both rounded to the nearest integer.
 * If \f$k_{\rm min}\f$ is less than 0, it is set to 0.  If \f$k_{\rm max}\f$
 * is negative or greater than \f$N/2\f$ rounded down, it is set to \f$N/2\f$
 * rounded down.  This ends up double-counting the DC and a possible Nyquist
 * component, but it is assumed these terms have negligible contribution to the
 * sum and there is no special case to handle them separately (most likely,
 * the detector will have no sensitivity to those components anyway).
 *
 * This routine will accept frequency series \f$\tilde{h}\f$ and \f$S_h\f$ that
 * have different frequency resolutions (i.e., different \f$\Delta f\f$).  In
 * this case, a new frequency series \f$S_h\f$ is computed with the same
 * resolution as \f$\tilde{h}\f$ by interpolation.  A simple linear
 * interpolation in the logarithm of the power spectral density is used.  Any
 * points where the power spectral density is zero are considered to be invalid
 * and are omitted from the sum.
 *
 * @param[in] htilde The Fourier transform of the signal strain.
 * @param[in] psd The one-sided detector strain noise power spectral density.

/**
 * @brief Measures the characteristic signal-to-noise ratio of a gravitational
 * waveform.
 *
 * This routine measures the characteristic signal-to-noise ratio of a signal
 * @p h for a detector with a given strain noise power spectral density @p psd.
 * Only frequency components of the signal between @p f_mim and @p f_max are
 * included in this measurement.  If @p f_min is zero or negative, no lower
 * bound is imposed.  If @p f_max is negative, no upper bound is imposed.
 *
 * A copy of the strain time series @p h is zero padded up to the next power of
 * two in length and then Fourier transformed; the routine XLALMeasureSNRFD()
 * is then used to compute the characteristic signal-to-noise ratio.  See
 * XLALMeasureSNRFD() for further details.
 *
 * @param[in] h The strain time series of the signal.
 * @param[in] psd The one-sided detector strain noise power spectral density.
 * @param[in] f_min The lower bound of the frequency band over which the
 * signal-to-noise ratio will be computed; set to 0 or a negative value for no
 * lower bound.
 * @param[in] f_max The upper bound of the frequency band over which the
 * signal-to-noise ratio will be computed; set to a negative value for
 * no upper bound.
 * @returns The characteristic signal to noise ratio.
 * @retval LAL_REAL8_FAIL_NAN Failure.
