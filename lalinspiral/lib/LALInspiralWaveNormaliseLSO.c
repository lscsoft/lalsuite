 * \brief Module to find the norm of a signal and to return a normaliseLSOd
 * array. The original signal is left untouched.
 *
 * ### Prototypes ###
 *
 * <tt>LALInspiralWaveNormaliseLSO()</tt>
 *
 * ### Description ###
 *
 * Given the positive frequency Fourier components
 * \f$H_k,\f$ \f$k=0,\ldots,n-1,\f$ of a vector
 * and the noise PSD \f$S_m,\f$ \f$m=0,\ldots,n/2,\f$
 * this module first computes the norm \f$H\f$ of the vector treating
 * \f$S_m\f$ as the measure:
 * (note that in {\em fftw} notation, the zeroth frequency
 * component is \f$H_0,\f$ Nyquist
 * is \f$H_{n/2},\f$ \f$H_k,\f$ \f$k \ne 0,n/2,\f$ (\f$H_{n-k})\f$ is the real (imaginary)
 * part of the \f$k\f$th harmonic)
 * \f{equation}{
 * \label{eq_inspiralnorm}
 * H = \sum_{k=1}^{n/2-1} \frac{H_k^2 + H^2_{n-k}}{S_k}.
 * \f}
 * <tt>The above sum is limited to frequency</tt> <tt>in->fCutoff.</tt>
 * Also, note that the zeroth and Nyquist frequency components
 * are ignored in the computation of the norm.
 * Moreover, <tt>array elements of</tt> \c filter corresponding
 * to frequencies greater than <tt>in->fCutoff</tt> are <tt>set to zero</tt>.
 * That is, the code replaces the original vector \f$H_k\f$ with <em>normalized
 * vector</em> using:
 * \f{eqnarray}{
 * \widehat H_k & = & \frac {H_k}{\sqrt H},
 * \ \ \ \mathrm{k \times in\rightarrow\mathrm df} \le \mathrm{in\rightarrow fCutoff}, \\
 * & = & 0, \ \ \ \mathrm{k \times in\rightarrow df} > \mathrm{in\rightarrow fCutoff}.
 * \f}
 * In addition, the 0th and Nyquist frequency components are also set to zero.
 *
