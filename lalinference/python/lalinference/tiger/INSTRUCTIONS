# INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE TIGER POST PROCESSING SCRIPT
#
###############################################################################

The tiger post processing script takes the user from the output of the backend
lalinference runs to a summary page and the corresponding plots of the tiger
results. The main maths and the algorithm of tiger are described in Ref [1].

1. USAGE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The tiger postproc script can be used in two distinct modes

1. Standalone python script. You can run the script by either calling the
python interpreter explicitly by

python /path/to/script/postproc.py 

or by making and running the script as an executable by

/path/to/script/postproc.py

2. Or as a library to use the functions in your own script by

from lalinference.tiger.postproc import *

The remainder of this instruction file will mainly describe the use of this
script as a standalone python script.

2. REQUIREMENTS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are several requirements that a user must meet before he or she can run
the post processing script. These are

1. Python (tested on version 2.7.4)
2. Numpy (tested on version 1.7.1)
3. Scipy (tested on version 0.11.0)
4. Access to LDG clusters (if data is stored on LDG clusters)

3. INPUT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The input of the tiger post processing are output of inference codes such as
lalinference or lalnest. The minimum required output of the inference codes are

1. Bayes factors
2. Signal-to-noise ratios

Other features such as posterior combinations of modGR parameters are not part
of the main tiger method, but are currently under construction. So optional
input would be

1. Posterior samples

The specifics of the input are specified by a so-called configuration file
(typically with an extension .cfg). An example of a configuration file can be
generated through 

python /path/to/script/postproc.py -g FILENAME

where FILENAME is a user-specified string to where the example script will be
written. The configuration file has several options that specify the input of
to the code, but also several options for the output of the code. In this
section, we will only discuss the options relevant to the input of the code.
The section within the configuration file relevant to the output of the code
will be described further down.

[run] engine: specifies the engine of the run. Currently, only lalinference and
lalnest are supported.

[run] hypotheses: The testing coefficients used for the tiger run. See the data
generation script if unsure.

[run] runid: Run identifier to separate different runs. Will be used in the
output file names.

[run] localdest: Output directory of the code

[fetch] type: The script can read two types of files at the moment. The script
can either pull the sources directory (type=source). If you specify the source
option, the user needs to point the location file to the another file
containing the location of the sources (see [fetch] locs). The script can also
load files from python pickles (type=pickle). To use the pickle option, point
the location file directly to the pickle file (currently, only local pickles
are supported).

[fetch] locs: Location of either a file containing the locations of the source
data ([fetch] type=source) or the location of the python pickle ([fetch]
type=pickle). For type=source, the locs must point to an additional file where
each row has the cluster and the directory within that cluster.

[fetch] labels: Labels for individual tiger runs (e.g. background/foreground).
Used for file creation only.

[fetch] latexlabels: same as [fetch] labels, but only used for with the plots.
This string may contain latex typesetting.

[fetch] seed: If the seed is nonzero, the code will randomize the order in
which the sources are distributed within a catalogue. (NB: currently under
construction, do not use other than seed=0)

4. INTERNAL STRUCTURE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once the input has been specified, the script will 

1. Search for usable sources in the specified locations
2. Download the relevant Bayes factors and SNRs (and posterior samples if
specified).
3. Combines the data into odds ratio and other relevant statistics
4. Outputs the plots and html summary page

To set the script to run with the input specified in a configuration file,
simply issue the command

python /path/to/script/postproc.py -c FILENAME

where FILENAME is the name of the configuration file.

To perform the post processing the script has within it classes, methods and
function, which will be described in what follows.

TigerRun (class): Contains information and function relevant for a single tiger
run (e.g. single seed). 
* Members include the gps times of useful sources, location of the bayes factor
	files, etc. 
* Functions include searching for sources, downloading bayes factor, etc

TigerSet (class): Contains multiple instances of the TigerRun class that make
up a single category of runs (e.g. background, tidal deformation, etc). 
TigerSet (class): Contains some similar members and functions compared to the
TigerRun class, but aggregates information across different TigerRuns. 

There are also function that operate on TigerSets, mainly those that create the
plots are calculate statistics. For example, TigerCreateHistogram takes a list
of TigerSets and output the odds ratio histograms of all the TigerSets in the
input list.

Note: There is an effort ongoing to add another class to hold single source
information. This might be needed when analysing real data, when one might also
have to make distinction between different sources within a single run. An
example would be the distinction between double and triple time analyses.

5. OUTPUT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The output of the tiger post processing is summarised by a simple html page
containing

1. Statistics (efficiency [1], KS statistic, p-value, etc)
2. Comparative plots (e.g. background vs foreground)
3. Links to single set specific plots (e.g. cumulative frequency plots)

The output of the tiger post processing can also receive input from the
configuration file. For example, which plots are produced is set under the
section [plot], and the amount of bins in the histograms are set by the [hist]
bin option. Look at the example configuration file for details.

6. USE AS A LIBRARY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The tiger post processing script can be used as a library instead of a
standalone script. This might be useful if you want to use the function in an
interactive python environment (e.g. ipython) or if you want to make your own
derivative scripts. 

Once you have build lal and have the relevant paths in your environment
variable (in particular $PYTHONPATH), you can simply load the tiger
postprocessing libraries by 

from lalinference.tiger.postproc import *

or alternatively

import lalinference.tiger.postproc as tig
