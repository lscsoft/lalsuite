 *      Accelerated 1D and 2D cubic interpolation
 *      1. Constant boundary conditions
 *      2. Robust to invalid data: drops to linear or nearest-neighbor
 *         when the input data contains NaNs or infinities
 *      3. Bounds and invalid value checks are precomputed:
 *         minimal branch instructions needed in evaluate function
 *      5. Interpolating polynomial is precomputed:
 *         modest speedup relative to naive 1D interpolant,
 *         4x speedup over relative to naive 2D interpolant
 *         at the cost of 16x the memory footprint
