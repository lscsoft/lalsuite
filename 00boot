# version. This can lead to unexpected build failures therefore to work
# round this "feature" we set the LIBTOOLIZE enviroment variable to
# point to the the true executable which bypasses the running of
# libtoolize, this will not effect the vast majority of users and those
# it will effect will know how to run libtoolize, if required.
