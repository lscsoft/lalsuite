HOWTO compile ComputeFStatistic for Windows and build a BOINC client from it
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This document should tell you how to build ComputeFStatistic as a
BOINC client for Windows.

Two different cases are documented here, depending on the compiler used:
Case A: Microsoft Visual C++ .NET with wrapper
Case B: Cross-compiling with MinGW (e.g. on Linux). No BOINC support here.


Environment Prerequisites
-------------------------

Case A: Microsoft Visual C .NET with wrapper

I Installation

1. Install MSVS .NET
Sounds easy. Takes its time, especially if you're short with disk space.
Make sure you have some GB free. The need to strip the distribution down
costs time and maybe further trouble.

2. Install Cygwin (from www.cygwin.com)
You may not need all that is available, but make sure you get the
develoment package. I suggest that you also get "wget".
The installation should leave you with a Cygwin icon on your desktop. By
double-clicking it, you will open a Cygwin shell (bash).

3. Make "vscygwin.bat" (or any other name you can remember)
Each of the two installations above builds a batch file specific to your
system and installtion options.
Locate the file "vsvars32.bat" of the Visual Studio. On my system this
is in "D:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003\Common7\Tools"
Make a copy of it, on the desktop or wherever you can find it, naming it
"vscygwin.bat"
Find "cygwin.bat". It is located right in the directory you installed
Cygwin into, usually C:\cygwin .
Open "vscygwin.bat" with an editor (right click on it and choose
"Edit"). Add a line containing the path to cygwin.bat at the end, e.g.
"C:\cygwin\cygwin.bat". Save and Exit. Opening (double-click)
"vscygwin.bat" should now give you a Cygwin shell with the proper
environment settings for command line compilation with the MSVC
compiler. Check this by double-clicking the icon and typing "env". You
should see environment variables like "VS71COMNTOOLS", "VSINSTALLDIR"
etc. I will call this a VSCygwin shell.

4. automake 1.8
Make sure you have automake 1.8 (or higher, and corresponding autoconf
version) installed on cygwin. (Type "automake --version" in a Cygwin
shell). If not, get it as a cygwin package or get the source (from
www.gnu.org), install and compile as you would on a Linux box ("tar
-xzvf source.tgz && cd source && ./configure && make && make install")

5. /work
Make a working directory. I will call this /work in the following, you
may choose any other name. Make a directory "bin" inside. Type "mkdir -p
/work/bin" in a Cygwin shell

6. wrapmsvc
Get the source distribution of the Coin project, version 2.* (I got
2.1.0) from ftp://ftp.coin3d.org/pub/coin/src/ and put it e.g. in /work.
Extract wrapmsvc.exe and put it into /work/bin.
If you have installed wget in Cygwin, just type:

cd /work
wget ftp://ftp.coin3d.org/pub/coin/src/Coin-2.1.0.tar.gz
tar -xzvf Coin-2.1.0.tar.gz Coin-2.1.0/cfg/wrapmsvc.exe
mv Coin-2.1.0/cfg/wrapmsvc.exe bin
rmdir -p Coin-2.1.0/cfg

7. ln replacement
The MSVC doesn't know of symbolic links the Cygwin style, so we have to
copy the files instead of linking them. For this we put a "ln"
replacement into /work/bin:

echo '#!/bin/sh
if [ "$1" = "-s" ]
 shift
fi
cp "$1" "$2"' >/work/bin/ln
chmod +x /work/bin/ln


II compilation with wrapmsvc - general overview

1. Open a VSCygwin shell

2. export PATH="/work/bin:$PATH"
The problem is that the MSVC compiler does not recognise what for Cygwin
are symbolic links. By putting /work/bin on the head of the PATH you
ensure that the "ln" that is contained there is taken when linking is
required. It actually copies the file instead of linking it.

3. Set the compiler to the MSC wrapper.

export CC=/work/bin/wrapmsvc.exe
export CXX=$CC

You may want to put something like the following in your $HOME/.bashrc
in Cygwin to get rid of steps 2 and 3 in the future and get the propper
setting whenever you open a VSCygwin shell:

echo '
if [ -n "$VCINSTALLDIR" ] ; then
 export PATH="/work/bin:$PATH"
 export CC=/work/bin/wrapmsvc.exe
 export CXX=$CC
 export PS1="${PS1}VSCygwin> "
fi
' >> $HOME/.bashrc

4. Configure and make as usual
./configure --prefix=/work && make && make install

5 (libraries only). Rename the libraries
The make procedure for libraries ends with lib<name>.lib . However the
MS Linker doensn't recognize these files as the libraries; he expects
them being <name>.lib. So we copy them (we may also rename them) to give
them the names the MS linker looks for.

( cd /work/lib ; for i in lib*.lib ; do
  cp "$i" "`echo $i | sed 's/^lib//'`" ; done )



Case B: Cross-compiling with MinGW

I Installation

Follow http://www.libsdl.org/extras/win32/cross/README.txt

II Cross-compiling

Basically you configure and make the source as usual, but use the
scripts "cross-configure.sh" and "cross-make.sh" instead of the ususal
"./configure" and "make". They just set a few environment variables
before exec to the normal programs.




Building ComputeFStatistic
--------------------------

The following paragraphs explain how to build the libraries and finally
the ComputeFStatistic executable with the MSVC compiler and wrapper.
These are shell commands which you can simply copy and paste to a
VSCygwin shell. They expect the PATH and CC variables set as explained
under the "compilation with wrapmsvc" topic above. If you use /work as
your working directory, they should work without alterations. Comments
are marked with the usual #.

These instructions also apply if you are cross-compiling with MinGW,
with some exceptions:
- Don't execute the commands following a "#Not needed for MinGW" line.
Most of them doesn't harm, but its at your own risk.
- use the "cross-" scripts instead of "./configure" and "make"
