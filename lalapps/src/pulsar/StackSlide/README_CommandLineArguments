#Key to terminology: 
#BLKs: The input blocks of frequency domain data (e.g., from SFTs). 
#STKs: The BLK data is stacked up and turned in STKs. 
#SUMs: The STKs are slid and then summed to produce SUMs; 

#For historical reasons, parameters for controlling Monte Carlo Simulations occur in several places.
#See: maxMCinterations, maxMCErr, orientationAngle, cosInclinationAngle, weightFlag, testFlag, numMCInjections, numMCRescalings, rescaleMCFraction, parameterMC, and debugOptionFlag.

#Note that for the isolated search case, to make Monte Carlo simulations with spindown work properly and self-consistently with the search one needs to:
# 1. Use lal/packages/pulsar/src/ComputeSky.c version 1.11 or higher.
# 2. Use lal/packages/inject/src/GeneratePulsarSignal.c version 1.40 or higher.
# 3. Make sure gpsEpochStartTimeSec == gpsStartTimeSec = start time of the first BLK of data (i.e., the first SFT) and that gpsEpochStartTimeNan == 0.
#When not running a Monte Carlo simulation set gpsEpochStartTimeSec and gpsEpochStartTimeNan to any T_0 desired, giving the start of the epoch at the SSB.
