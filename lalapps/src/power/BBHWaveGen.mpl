# The idea of this program is to allow one to generate BBH kludge waveforms in
# a semi-automated way. The calculation of the waveform follows the paper of
# Flanagan and Hughes (F&H) to get h_+ and h_x for a binary black hole system
# that includes a 2PN inspiral, an ad-hoc merger which has characteristics
# similar to simulations that currently exist, and a ringdown. The masses and
# final angular momentum of the binary system will be parameters we select. At
# the end of the day, I hope to code some C functions that I can use to
# generate these signals on the fly.
