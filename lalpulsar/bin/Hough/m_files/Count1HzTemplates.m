%  Matlab script to count the number of templates used in a 1 Hz band
%  for the full sky search
%  This will change for the different frequency bands.

% Remember to add the path where this file is located:
% addpath /scratch/sintes/CVSDIR/waves/people/sintes/PULSAR/CODES/m_files/
%   To run simply type Count1HzTemplates
