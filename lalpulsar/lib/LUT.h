 *
 * Our goal is the construction of Hough maps. In order to produce them
 * efficiently, the present implemetation makes use of <tt>lut</tt>s.
 * Here we provide the necessary routines for their construction and use.
 *
 * In principle, the subroutines provided are valid for
 * any Hough master equation of the form:
 * \f[ \nu-F_0  =\vec\xi (t) \cdot (\hat n -\hat N )\, ,\f]
 * where \f$ \nu \f$ is the measured frequency of the signal at time \f$ t \f$ ,
 * \f$ F_0 \f$ intrinsic frequency of the signal at that time, \f$ \hat n \f$ location of the
 * souce in the sky, \f$ \hat N \f$ the center of the sky patch used in the
 * demodulation procedure,
 * and
 * \f$ \vec\xi (t) \f$ any vector.
 *
 * The  form of this vector \f$ \vec\xi (t) \f$
 * depends on the demodulation procedure
 * used in the previous  step.  In our case this corresponds to
 * \f[\vec\xi (t) = \left( F_0+
 * \sum_k F_k \left[ \Delta T  \right]^k\right) \frac{\vec v(t)}{c}
 * + \left( \sum_k k F_k \left[ \Delta  T \right]^{k-1}\right)
 * \frac {\vec x(t)- \vec x(\hat t_0)}{c}\, ,\f]
 * and
 * \f[F_0 \equiv  f_0 + \sum_k \Delta f_k
 * \left[ \Delta T \right]^k \, , \f]
 * where
 * \f$ \vec v(t) \f$ is the velocity of the detector, \f$ \vec x(t) \f$ is the detector
 * position,
 * \f$ T_{\hat N}(t) \f$ is the  time  at
 * the solar system barycenter (for a given sky
 * location \f$ \hat N \f$ ),
 * \f$ \Delta T \equiv T_{\hat N}(t)-T_{\hat N}(\hat t_0) \f$ ,
 * \f$ \Delta f_k = f_k-F_k \f$ the  residual spin-down parameter,
 * \f$ F_k \f$ the  spin-down parameter used in the demodulation, and \f$ f_0 \f$ , \f$ f_k \f$ the
 * intrinsic  frequency and spin-down parameters of the source at time \f$ \hat t_0 \f$ .
 *
 * Looking at the generic Hough master equation, one realizes that
 * for a fixed  time, a given value of \f$ F_0 \f$ , and a measured frequency \f$ \nu \f$
 * p(from a selected peak), the source could be located anywhere on a circle (whose
 * center points in the same direction of \f$ \vec\xi (t) \f$ and is characterized by
 * \f$ \phi \f$ , the angle between \f$ \hat n \f$ and \f$ \vec\xi \f$ ).  Since the Hough transform is performed on a
 * set of spectra with discrete frequencies, a peak on the spectrum appearing at
 * \f$ \nu \f$ could correspond to any source with a demodulated
 * frequency in a certain interval. As a consequence, the location of the sources
 * compatible with \f$ F_0 \f$ and \f$ \nu \f$ is not a circle but an annulus with a certain
 * width.
 *
 * Our purpose is to map these annuli on a discrete space. An estimation of the
 * average thickness of the annuli  tells us that the vast majority of
 * annuli will be very thin, and therefore our algorithm should not be
 * optimized for drawing
 * thick annuli but for thin ones. Also, the mapping implementation should be one with a uniform
 * probability distribution in order to avoid discretization errors.
 * In order to remove border effects, we use a biunivocal mapping, which
 * requires
 * that a pixel in a partial Hough map can belong only to one annulus,
 * just touched by one peak of the spectrum. The criteria for the biunivocal mapping
 * is that if and only if the center of the pixel is inside the annulus, then the pixel
 * will be enhanced.
 *
 * In order to simplify  (reduce the computational cost of) this task we
 * construct look up tables (<tt>lut</tt>) where the  borders of these annuli are
 * marked for any possible \f$ \nu -F_0 \f$ value. Since we work on a discrete space these <tt>lut</tt> are
 * valid for many \f$ F_0 \f$ values.

 *
 * At this point we have already chosen a sky tiling to produce the Hough map  efficiently.
 * It consists of changing coordinates so that the center of the   patch is located at
 * \f$ (0,-\pi/2) \f$ in ( \f$ \alpha-\delta \f$ ) (or in any other coordinate system), then we make use
 * of the stereographic projection (see \ref LUTstereo "this figure") and we take horizontal and vertical lines on
 * the projected plane at constant space separation.
 * This projection is advantageous because it avoids distortions, i.e. the
 * pixel size is almost constant independently of the sky location, and makes the
 * algorithm simpler. The stereographic projection has the property to map circles
 * on the celestial sphere to circles on the projected plane.
