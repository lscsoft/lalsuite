# Contributing to LALSuite

This page outlines the recommended procedure for contributing changes to the
LALSuite repository. Please read the [IGWN Computing Guide to
GitLab][compguidegit] before you start.

## Reporting issues

If you have `ligo.org` authentication, please report issues directly through
GitLab. Otherwise, you can use the [service desk address][helpdesk] to send bug
reports by e-mail.

In either case, please include as much detail as possible to reproduce the
error, including information about your operating system and the version of each
(relevant) component of LALSuite. If possible, please include a brief,
self-contained code example that demonstrates the problem.

Note that when an issue is marked as *Confidential*, currently this means that
most internal users will also not be able to see it, but only a small number of
people with reporter, developer or maintainer status.

## Building LALSuite

Please see [here][buildfromsrc] for instructions on building LALSuite from source.

## Contributing code

All contributions to LALSuite code must be made using the fork and [merge
request][mergerequests] [workflow][forkworkflow], which must then be reviewed by
one of the project maintainers.

If you wish to contribute new code, or changes to existing code, please follow
this development workflow:

### Configure Git

You should first ensure that Git is correctly configured on your machine. In
particular, you should set your name and email address; these will appear on any
commits made to the LALSuite repository. To do this, run these commands:

1. ```bash
   git config --global user.name "..."
   ```

   where `...` is replaced with your name (i.e. your human name, not your
   computer user/login name).

1. ```bash
   git config --global user.email "..."
   ```

   where `...` is replaced with your email address, preferably a `@ligo.org`
   address if you have one.

You only need to do this **once for every machine** you will use to develop
LALSuite.

For a complete guide to configuring Git for the first time, see
[here][gitsetup].

### Make a fork (copy) of LALSuite

You only need to do this **once**.

1. Go to the [LALSuite repository home page][lalsuiterepo].

1. Click on the *Fork* button, that should lead you [here][lalsuiteforks].

1. Select the namespace that you want to create the fork in, this will usually
   be your personal namespace.

If you can't see the *Fork* button, make sure that you are logged in by checking
for your account profile photo in the top right-hand corner of the screen.

### Clone your fork

Make sure that you have installed and configured [Git-LFS][gitlfs]:

```bash
git lfs install
```

for the management of large files. This is required to successfully build and
install your development fork.

Then, clone your fork with

```bash
git clone git@git.ligo.org:<namespace>/lalsuite.git
```

### Installing pre-commit hooks

LALSuite uses pre-commit hooks to check/fix a variety of code quality issues.
These are run by the [`pre-commit`][precommit] tool, which can be installed
using `conda`, `pip`, etc. Once `pre-commit` is installed, it must be
configured:

```bash
cd lalsuite
pre-commit install
```

You only need to do this **once**.

The pre-commit hooks are run every time a new commit is made. If any code
quality issues are identified, these will usually be fixed automatically, but
you will need to include the extra changes in the commit e.g. using `git
add`. Once all code quality issues are resolved, the new commit will be created.

### Keeping your fork up to date

Link your clone to the main (`upstream`) repository so that you can `fetch` and
`pull` changes, `merge` them with your clone, and `push` them to your fork. Do
*not* make changes on your master branch.

1. Link your fork to the main repository:

    ```bash
    cd lalsuite
    git remote add upstream git@git.ligo.org:lscsoft/lalsuite.git
    ```

   You only need to do this **once**.

1. Update your `master` branch to track changes from upstream:

    ```bash
    git checkout master
    git fetch upstream
    git branch --set-upstream-to upstream/master
    git pull
    ```

   You only need to do this **once**.

1. Fetch new changes from the `upstream` repository, merge them with your master
   branch, and push them to your fork on `git.ligo.org`:

    ```bash
    git checkout master
    git pull
    git push origin master
    ```

1. You can see which remotes are configured using

   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

   If you have followed the instructions thus far, you should see four
   lines. Lines one and two begin with `origin` and reference your fork on
   `git.ligo.org` with both `fetch` and `push` methods. Lines three and four
   begin with `upstream` and refer to the main repository on `git.ligo.org` with
   both `fetch` and `push` methods.

### Making changes

All changes should be developed on a feature branch in order to keep them
separate from other work, thus simplifying the review and merge once the work is
complete. The workflow is:

1. Create a new feature branch configured to track the `master` branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git pull
   git checkout -b my-new-feature upstream/master
   ```

   This command creates the new branch `my-new-feature`, sets up tracking the
   `upstream` repository, and checks out the new branch. There are other ways to
   do these steps, but this is a good habit since it will allow you to `fetch`
   and `merge` changes from `upstream/master` directly onto the branch.

1. Develop the changes you would like to introduce, using `git commit` to
   finalise a specific change. Ideally commit small units of change often,
   rather than creating one large commit at the end, this will simplify review
   and make modifying any changes easier.

   Commit messages should be clear, identifying which code was changed, and
   why. Common practice is to use a short summary line (<50 characters),
   followed by a blank line, then more information in longer lines.

1. Push your changes to the remote copy of your fork on `git.ligo.org`. The
   first `push` of any new feature branch will require the `-u/--set-upstream`
   option to `push` to create a link between your new branch and the `origin`
   remote:

    ```bash
    git push --set-upstream origin my-new-feature
    ```

    Subsequent pushes can be made with just:

    ```bash
    git push
    ```

1. Keep your feature branch up to date with the `upstream` repository by doing:

   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git pull
   git checkout my-new-feature
   git rebase upstream/master
   git push -f origin my-new-feature
   ```

   This works if you created your branch with the `checkout` command above. If
   you forgot to add the `upstream/master` starting point, then you will need to
   dig deeper into git commands to get changes and merge them into your feature
   branch.

   If there are conflicts between `upstream` changes and your changes, you will
   need to resolve them before pushing everything to your fork.

### Open a merge request

When you feel that your work is finished, you should create a merge request to
propose that your changes be merged into the main (`upstream`) repository.

After you have pushed your new feature branch to `origin`, you should find a new
button on the [LALSuite repository home page][lalsuiterepo] inviting you to
create a merge request out of your newly pushed branch. (If the button does not
exist, you can initiate a merge request by going to the `Merge Requests` tab on
your fork website on `git.ligo.org` and clicking `New merge request`)

You should click the button, and proceed to fill in the title and description
boxes on the merge request page:

- Please provide a descriptive title for the merge request.

- In the **Detailed Description** section of the description box, please provide
  a detailed description of the changes, why they are being made, etc. Also
  indicate appropriate tickets and tests that have been run to determine that
  the changes work as intended and do not introduce other problems.

- In the **API Changes** section of the description box, please tick one of the
  following checkboxes:

  - *These changes do not modify the API*. Examples of such changes are:
    - C code:
      - No changes to a public C header (i.e. any `.h` header which is installed
        in `include/lal`).

    - Python code:

      - No changes to the arguments of a function/class method which is public
        (i.e. its name is not preceded by an `_`).

      - No new public functions/class methods.

      - No new classes/modules.

  - *These changes are backwards compatible*. Examples of such changes are:

    - C code:

      - Adding a new type/struct/function to a public C header.

    - Python code:

      - Adding a new optional argument to an existing public function/class
        method, which does not change behaviour if the default value is used.

      - Adding a new public function/class method.

      - Adding a new class/module.

  - *These changes are backwards incompatible*. Examples of such changes are:

    - C code:

      - Modifying an existing type/struct/function in a public C header.

      - Removing or renaming an existing type/struct/function from a public C
        header.

    - Python code:

      - Adding a new positional (i.e. non-optional) argument to an existing
        public function/class method.

      - Removing or renaming arguments (even optional ones) of an existing
        public function/class method.

      - Changing the return values of an existing public function/class method.

      - Removing or renaming an existing public function/class method.

      - Removing or renaming a class/module.

- If you checked the *These changes are backwards incompatible* checkbox:

  - In the **Justification for Backwards Incompatible Changes** section of the
    description box, please provide a justification for why these changes are
    necessary and why they need to be done in a backwards incompatible way.

- In the **Review Status** section of the description box, please provide
  details on any reviews related to these changes and the associated reviewers.

- It is recommended that you check the box to *Remove source branch when merge
  request is accepted*; this will result in the branch being automatically
  removed from your fork when the merge request is accepted.

Once the request has been opened, one of the maintainers will assign someone to
review the change. There may be suggestions and/or discussion with the
reviewer. These interactions are intended to make the resulting changes
better. The reviewer will merge your request.

Once the changes are merged into the upstream repository, you should remove the
development branch from your clone using

```bash
git branch -d my-new-feature
```

A feature branch should *not* be repurposed for further development as this can
result in problems merging upstream changes.

### Continuous integration

GitLab runs continuous integration (CI) pipelines on LALSuite to ensure that it
builds and passes its test suite on a wide variety of platforms. There are 2
main CI pipelines:

1. The push CI pipeline runs whenever you push commit(s) to your LALSuite
   fork. This pipeline performs some basic checks that LALSuite still builds and
   passes its tests with your changes:

   - each component LALSuite package can be build and installed in sequence (the
     so-called *package-level build*);

   - LALSuite can build all component packages at once (the so-called *top-level
     build*);

   - the LALSuite [Doxygen][doxygen] documentation can be built;

   - some basic checks for code style/formatting/whitespace errors, build
     byproduct files missing from `.gitignore`, etc.

1. The merge CI pipeline runs when you are ready to submit your changes to the
   upstream LALSuite fork via a merge request. This pipeline runs a much more
   comprehensive series of checks that LALSuite still builds and passes its
   tests with a wide variety of platforms (e.g. MacOS, various Linux
   distributions) and compilers (e.g. `clang`, `icc`, `gcc`). It also checks
   that LALSuite packages for a number of package management systems (e.g. RPM,
   Debian, Conda, Python wheels) are built correctly.

3. (A third CI pipeline runs nightly on the [main LALSuite
   repository][lalsuiterepo] fork for deployment tasks, e.g. updating the
   [online documentation][nightlydocs]).

You can request a subset of the jobs which normally run as part of the merge
pipeline to also be run as part of the push pipeline. This is useful if you are
making changes to LALSuite which could potentially cause problems with different
platforms/compilers, or which could affect the packaging, and you want to test
the effect of your changes before submitting a merge request.

For individual commits, you can request a subset of merge pipeline jobs to run
by adding key text to the commit message, as listed in the table below. If
instead you have a branch where you want a subset of merge pipeline jobs to be
run on every push, you can name the branch to match one of the regular
expressions given in the table below.

| If commit message contains | Or branch name matches    | Action                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

| `[ci coverage]`            | `/[-_]ci[-_]coverage/`    | Report test suite coverage                                   |
| `[ci deb]`                 | `/[-_]ci[-_]deb/`         | Build Debian packages                                        |

| `[ci docs]`                | `/[-_]ci[-_]docs/`        | Build the documentation                                      |
| `[ci full]`                | n/a                       | Run all jobs in the merge pipeline                           |
| `[ci integration]`         | `/[-_]ci[-_]integration/` | Longer-running integration/build configuration tests         |

| `[ci pkg]`                 | `/[-_]ci[-_]pkg/`         | Perform a basic package-level build from tarballs            |
| `[ci platform]`            | `/[-_]ci[-_]platform/`    | Test different platforms (MacOS, various Linux distros)      |
| `[ci rpm]`                 | `/[-_]ci[-_]rpm/`         | Build RPM packages                                           |

Note: The `[ci nightly]` and `[ci tags]` pipelines do not execute any deployment
actions with external consequences, e.g. deploying documentation, pushing
packages to repositories. These actions can only be executed by the third CI
pipeline which runs nightly on the main `lscsoft/lalsuite` fork.

### Pretty code formatting

You may optionally specify that certain C or Python sources should be _pretty
formatted_ in a consistent style, which will be enforced by the CI pipelines.

* C code is pretty-formatted using [Artistic Style][prettyastyle], which
  supports a number of C coding styles and options. It is enabled by creating
  files with a `.pretty.astylerc` extension; the contents of these files are
  read for the C coding style options to pass to Artistic Style. Three types of
  files are supported:

  * A C source level file, e.g. `lallib/path/to/.MyModule.pretty.astylerc`, will
    pretty-format the C source file(s) `lallib/path/to/MyModule.[ch]`;

  * A directory level file, e.g. `lallib/path/to/.pretty.astylerc` will
    pretty-format all C source files in `lallib/path/to/`;

  * A LALSuite library level file, e.g. `lallib/.pretty.astylerc`, will
    pretty-format all C source files in `lallib/`.

* Python code is pretty-formatted using [Black][prettyblack]. It is enabled by
  creating files with a `.pretty.black` extension; since Black does not take any
  coding style options, the contents of these files are not examined. Three
  types of files are supported:

  * A Python source level file, e.g. `lallib/path/to/.MyModule.pretty.black`,
    will pretty-format the Python source file `lallib/path/to/MyModule.py`;

  * A directory level file, e.g. `lallib/path/to/.pretty.black` will
    pretty-format all Python source files in `lallib/path/to/`;

  * A LALSuite library level file, e.g. `lallib/.pretty.black`, will
    pretty-format all Python source files in `lallib/`.

The pre-commit hooks will check that your local changes are pretty-formatted correctly.
