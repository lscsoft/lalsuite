 *
 * ### Description ###
 *
 * The \c REAL4 routines are described below.  These use single-precision
 * FFTs, i.e., they convert \c REAL4Vectors into \c COMPLEX8Vectors
 * and vice-versa.  The \c REAL8 versions of the routines are the same
 * but they are double-precision versions, i.e., they convert
 * \c REAL8Vectors into \c COMPLEX16Vectors.
 *
 * The routine XLALCreateREAL4FFTPlan() creates a REAL4FFTPlan
 * structure to perform FFTs of vectors of length \c size.  If
 * \c fwdflg is non-zero then the plan is created to perform forward
 * (real-to-complex) FFTs with a negative exponential sign.  Otherwise
 * the plan is created to perform reverse (complex-to-real) FFTs with a
 * positive exponential sign.  The value of \c measurelvl determines
 * how much optimization of the plan FFTW will do with the most optimization
 * taking the most amount of time.  Reasonable values for \c measurelvl
 * would be 0 for the fasted plan creation (FFTW does not measure the speed
 * of any transform with this level but rather estimates which plan will
 * be the fastet) or 1 to measure a few likely plans to determine the fastest.
 *
 * XLALCreateForwardREAL4FFTPlan() is equivalent to
 * XLALCreateREAL4FFTPlan() with \c fwdflg set to 1.
 * XLALCreateReverseREAL4FFTPlan() is equivalent to
 * XLALCreateREAL4FFTPlan() with \c fwdflg set to 0.
 *
 * XLALDestroyREAL4FFTPlan() is used to destroy the plan, freeing all
 * memory that was allocated in the structure as well as the structure
 * itself.  It can be used on either forward or reverse plans.
 *
 * XLALREAL4ForwardFFT() and
 * XLALREAL4ReverseFFT() perform forward (real to complex) and
 * reverse (complex to real) transforms respectively.  The plan supplied
 * to these routines must be correctly generated for the direction of the
 * transform.  I.e., XLALREAL4ForwardFFT() cannot be supplied with
 * a plan generated by XLALCreateReverseREAL4FFTPlan().
 *
 * XLALREAL4VectorFFT() is a low-level routine that transforms
 * a real vector to a half-complex real vector (with a forward plan) or
 * a half-complex real vector to a real vector (with a reverse plan).
 * If you're not sure what this means, don't use this routine.
 * The input and output vectors (and their data) must be distinct pointers.
 *
 * XLALREAL4PowerSpectrum() computes a real power spectrum of the
 * input real vector and a forward FFT plan.
 *
 * ### Return Values ###
 *
 * Upon success,
 * XLALCreateREAL4FFTPlan(),
 * XLALCreateForwardREAL4FFTPlan(), and
 * XLALCreateReverseREAL4FFTPlan() return a pointer to a newly-allocated
 * FFT plan.  Upon failure, they return a \c NULL pointer and set
 * \c xlalErrno to one of the following values:
 * #XLAL_EBADLEN if \c size is not greater than zero,
 * #XLAL_ENOMEM if a memory allocation failed, or
 * #XLAL_EFAILED if the FFTW plan creation routine failed.
 *
 * XLALDestroyREAL4FFTPlan() does not return any value but, upon
 * failure, it will set \c xlalErrno to one of the following values:
 * #XLAL_EFAULT if the routine is provided a \c NULL pointer, or
 * #XLAL_EINVAL if the contents of the plan are invalid (e.g., if the
 * routine is provided a plan that had been previously destroyed).
 *
 * XLALREAL4ForwardFFT(),
 * XLALREAL4ReverseFFT(),
 * XLALREAL4VectorFFT(), and
 * XLALREAL4PowerSpectrum() return the value 0 upon succes; upon
 * failure they return #XLAL_FAILURE and set xlalErrno to
 * one of the following values:
 * #XLAL_EFAULT if one of the input pointers is \c NULL,
 * #XLAL_EINVAL if the input, output, or plan structures appears
 * invalid or if the routine is passed a plan for the wrong transform
 * directions or if the input and output data pointers are not distinct
 * for XLALREAL4VectorFFT(),
 * #XLAL_EBADLEN if the input and output vectors and the plan have
 * incompatible lengths,
 * #XLAL_ENOMEM if a memory allocation of temporary internal memory
 * fails.
 *
 * As before, the \c REAL8 versions of these routines behave the
 * same way but for double-precision transforms.
