 *
 * \brief Provides routines to resample a time series.
 *
 * At present only integer downsampling of \c REAL4TimeSeries by a power of two is supported.
 *
 * ### Synopsis ###
 *
 * \code
 * #include <lal/ResampleTimeSeries.h>
 * \endcode
 *
 * This header covers routines that resample time series by applying
 * a low pass filter and decimating the resulting time series. Further
 * documentation is given in the individual routines' modules.
