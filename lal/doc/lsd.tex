\chapter{Preface}

\bigskip
{\bf {\Huge{Preface to the first edition:}}}

\medskip
\noindent
The formal document governing the LAL-code and documentation is the
{\bf LIGO Data Analysis System Numerical Algorithms Library
Specification and Style Guide}
\verb@http://www.ligo.caltech.edu/docs/T/T990030-07.pdf@ (called the
LAL-Spec through out).  Like a constitution describing a government,
the guidelines given in the LAL-Spec are quite general. What is given
in this document  is a more like the criminal code: the nut-n-bolts
explanation of how to put the LAL-Spec into practice.  Like a
constitution, {\bf if there are any inconsistencies,  the LAL-Spec
takes precedence over any statements in this document.} Also like a
constitution, the LAL-Spec is to be taken very seriously, but it is
not suicide pact: if there are real problems with the Spec, there is a
formal process to change it.

The first part of this document gives a brief introduction to the LAL
and some coding and documentation instructions.  The second part is
the documentation of the LAL code itself.

{\bf {\Huge{Preface to the second edition:}}}

\medskip
\noindent
By necessity, the first edition of the
{{\textcolor{red}{\bf L}} {\textcolor{green}{\bf S}} {\textcolor{blue}{\bf D}} }
contained long lists of instructions that specified the layout
of the documentation and code; however many of these rules have
migrated to the LAL-Spec itself, and thus there is less need for
such rules.  Furthermore, now there is a much
larger body of example code  to help guide people in how to
follow the LAL rules.  Therefore Part I of this new edition of
the
{{\textcolor{red}{\bf L}} {\textcolor{green}{\bf S}} {\textcolor{blue}{\bf D}} }
is considerably shorter than its predessor.

    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Notes about coding}
\label{c:CodingNotes}

As mentioned above,  the marching orders for code development laid out
in the LAL-Spec are often quite general.  The purpose of this chapter
is try to record the collective interpretation of the LAL-Spec so that
we can consistently apply it.

\bigskip

{\noindent \bf Use of MACROS:} The LAL-Spec says ``macros'' are
deprecated.  What the hell does that mean? The interpretation we are
using clearly captures the intent.  There are a number of macros for
common use in the {\tt std} LAL files, but these under strict control
of the librarian.  In your modules (.c files), you may use macros to
replace small snippets of code.  However because header files may be
included in other code, you should not use macros in your {\tt .h}
files.

If you have a ``{\texttt {\#define SomeMacro}}'' that needs to be
included in many different files, it probably belongs in the {\tt
LALConstant.h} file or one of the other {\tt /lal/std/include} files.
Please contact the Librarian.

\bigskip

{\noindent \bf Defining the RCS ID string:}  The LAL-Spec
requires all header, module and test files to define the
RCS ID String with the following macro:
\begin{verbatim}
          NRCSID(LALTEMPLATEH,"$Id$");
\end{verbatim}
\noindent The reason we assign the Id with this macro is that without it,
the compiler prints annoying warning messages. Note this macro is an
example of one macros for ``common use'' described above.

\bigskip

{\noindent \bf Error Codes and Messages:} The LAL-Spec discusses the
statuscode and statusDesription, i.e. the error codes and  messages
returned by a LAL function. Here we solidify the name space
convention. These should be hash-defined in the header file, e.g. in
{\tt MyHeader.h} we would have
\begin{verbatim}
/* <lalErrTable file="MyHeaderHErrorTable"> */

#define MYHEADERH_ENUL  1
#define MYHEADERH_EOUT  2
#define MYHEADERH_EDIV  3

#define MYHEADERH_MSGENUL  "Null pointer"
#define MYHEADERH_MSGEOUT  "Output already exists"
#define MYHEADERH_MSGEDIV  "Division by zero"

/* </lalErrTable> */
\end{verbatim}
\noindent The names should begin with the file name and extension ({\tt h})
all converted to upper case. The error codes are followed by
{\tt \_E}$<$name$>$. The error messages are followed by
{\tt \_MSGE}$<$name$>$.

The $<>$ed key-words shown before and after the codes are the
key-words for automatic documentation system.  You must use these to
automate the inclusion of the error codes in the documentation.  More
on this later.

\chapter{The directory structure of the LAL}
\label{c:DirectoryStructure}

\newpage
\section{Schematic Diagram of Directory Structure}
This is a diagram showing the   directory structure of the LAL.
This comes straight from the LAL-Spec. In particular, this shows
and example package tdfilter  (time domain filters).

\noindent\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth,angle=0]{lsdFigDirStructure}

\chapter{Documenting your code}
\label{c:DocumentingCode}

Along with any code submission to the LAL library, you will need to
supply documentation. Keep in mind, the documentation, like the code,
is a {\it deliverable} and it must be written to the standard outlined
in the LAL-Spec.  This chapter gives specific instructions  on how
to meet the standard.

Also keep in mind that, unlike most code projects that physicists work
on, this code may still need to be maintained long after the author
has been denied tenure and starts working for a dot-com company.  This
puts a heavy burden on the documentation: not only should it help {\it
you} maintain {\it your} code, but it should require minimum effort
for {\it anyone} to figure out how the code works and how to fix it.
If you find yourself saying ``The easiest way for {\it me} to maintain
{\it my} code is ...'', you have missed the point.


In this chapter we discuss a few preliminaries, and give a general
outline of the documentation for a package.  Chapter
\ref{c:SamplePackage} is an example of how a the documentation for a
LAL package should be laid out. In Chapter \ref{c:laldoc} we explain
how to use the auto-documentation system ({\tt laldoc}).

\section{Use {\LaTeX}}

The documentation should be written in {\LaTeX}. This decision was made
by the LSC software committee.  The primary reason for this choice was
the need for the equation-writing capability of {\LaTeX}.

The danger in using {\LaTeX}  is that not everyone will have the same
version of {\LaTeX} installed on their machine. [Actually, this problem
might be as bad, or worse, with some other documenting tool.] Try to
help us minimize this problem by using vanilla {\LaTeX}.

Along with the LAL distribution, we supply a class file ({\tt
lal/doc/lal.sty}).  Although this is helpful and it makes thing look
nicer, it is not essential. You can remove it from the
\verb@\usepackage[]@ command in the various files and they should
still successfully {\LaTeX} without it.

\newpage
\section{The lay out of the documentation}

Most of the LDAS software is written in c++,  and therefore the
documentation is  naturally built around ``classes''.  However, the
LAL is written in c, and thus we cannot directly adopt the LDAS style
of documentation. None the less,  we try to mimic the style as close
as possible by building the LAL documentation around header files and
the modules and functions that include them.  This choice is also
natural because the hierarchical lay out of the documentation exactly
follows the hierarchy of the code.  [This is also the way books on
programming in c document the c-libraries.]

                       is in subsection {\large \bf N.2.2}.

    \vspace*{-0.1in}
    \item Documentation for the N+1'th package forms chapter {\large \bf N+1}.
    \item ... additional packages
\end{itemize}

Note: Although the LAL-Spec is not rigid on the subject, it suggests
that the number of modules and functions encompassed by a header file
should be small:  only ``small sets of related functions'' should
share the same header file. This means for a given header-file
section, there shouldn't be too many module subsections.


\section{Documentation for a single package versus a comprehensive LAL manual}

The LAL-Spec mentions two distinct forms the documentation must take:
stand-alone documentation for a single package and  a comprehensive
manual (with an exhaustive index and table of contents) for the entire
LAL.  In this section we describe how we implement these two competing
documentation specifications using the same {\LaTeX} source to build
both type of documents.

The requirement of both forms of the documentation in the LAL-Spec is
not capricious: both forms of the documentation are useful. When you
are working on a single package, having a short, single-package
document is handy.  This way you won't have to wait while {\LaTeX} runs
on the complete manual for the entire LAL every time you want to see
if your equations line up. On the other hand, as the LAL code becomes
more mature and some of it starts to perform highly integrated tasks,
it will be necessary for coders to have quick access to the entire
body of documentation.

{\bf Documentation for a single package:}
The guts of the documentation for a package (e.g. {\tt sample}) should reside in the
file {\tt /lal/packages/samplepackage/doc/sample.tex}.
This file may
itself have many \verb@\input{}@ commands in it to include files that
were auto extracted from the source-code files by {\tt laldoc}.

When LAL is built, the file  {\tt sample.tex}  will be
automatically included in the file {\tt main.tex} to build the
stand alone documentation  {\tt main.pdf} for this (or any
package). In other words, the file  {\tt main.pdf} in any {\tt
lal/package/doc} is the documentation for that package.

One problem you can have when you build the documentation of a single
package is that if their are references (\verb@\ref{}@'s)  to objects
outside the package, these will be left unresolved by {\LaTeX}.  Try to
minimize these by referring to the objects by name rather than section
number.  Remember, when the comprehensive document is built, it will
have a complete index and table of contents, so the reader should be
able to easily find the documentation for the objects by name.

{\bf Comprehensive manual for the entire LAL:} In the comprehensive
documentation directory ({\tt /lal/doc}) their is a file {\tt lsd.tex}
({\tt lsd} = LAL Software Documentation). This plays essentially the
same role as {\tt main.tex} described above; however this file has an
\verb@/include{}@ statement for every package in the LAL.

\section{What about figures?}

Figures are fine. When you submit a package of code and documentation
the figures should be in the {\tt /lal/packages/mypackage/doc} directory.
Please submit two versions of the figure: an {\tt .eps} and a {\tt .pdf}.
We need both so we can build the documentation either with
{\LaTeX} or {\tt pdflatex}.

The syntax to use for putting in the figure should be something like this
\begin{verbatim}
\resizebox{0.5\textwidth}{!}{\includegraphics{myHeaderFileNameMyFig}}
\end{verbatim}
Note. Don't include the extension on the figure file name in
the \verb@\includegraphics[]{}@ command. If you leave the extension off,
whatever method you use for building the documentation automatically
looks for the appropriate file.

{\bf Naming convention for figure files:} Using the base name of the
header file as the first part of the figure file name is a good idea.
The reason: when the documentation is built, everything is {\LaTeX}ed
in  the {\tt lal/doc/autodoc} directory. There are hundreds of files there,
and  following this convention will reduce the probability of a
name-space collision.

\section{Autodocumentation and Indexing }

\subsection{Autodocumentation requirements}
There is an automatic documentation tool supplied with the LAL.  To
what extent the coders wish to use the autodocmentation system, is
largely left up to their judgment and patience. However, the
LAL-Spec require several items to be auto-extracted from the code
to include the documentation. See the LAL-Spec for the official
list, but here are some examples

\begin{itemize}
  \item[$\bullet$] {\bf Function Prototypes}
  \item[$\bullet$] {\bf Error code tables }
  \item[$\bullet$] {\bf The author and version-control information.}  This
                        should appear as footnote at the bottom of all
                        header sections, and module and test subsections.
                        This can be done with the {\LaTeX} command
                        \verb@\vfill{\footnotesize\input{MyFileHAuthVer}}@,
                        where {\tt MYFILEHAuthVer.tex} is the file where
                        the Author-Version information from {\tt MyFile.H}
                        was extracted to.  You can find examples of
                        this to mimic.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Indexing requirements}

When this  document is built an index is also constructed. There are a few
code items that you must place in the index.
\begin{itemize}
  \item[$\bullet$] {\bf Functions} must be entered in the index, so
   users can find them. The \verb@\idx{}@ command should be right
   after the prototypes themselves are entered.  This insures the page
   number that appear in the index will be the page where the
   prototype is explained in the document.
   Use the LAL {\LaTeX} command
  \begin{verbatim}
  \idx{MyFunction()}
  \end{verbatim}
  \vspace*{-0.041in}
  \item[$\bullet$] {\bf Non LAL Data Structures}  must appear in the index.
  The LAL-Spec strongly encourages the using  LAL datatypes as the
  arguments for a function, but this isn't always possible. If you do
  use non-LAL datatypes, you must document them, and they must be
  included the index, so someone looking at your code can easily find
  the documentation.  The \verb@\idx[Type]{}@ command should be right after
  in the section where they are explained in the documentation.
  Here is an example of the LAL {\LaTeX} command you would use to get the
  name of your structure into the index.
  \begin{verbatim}
  \idx[Type]{MyType}
  \end{verbatim}
  \vspace*{-0.041in}
  \item[$\bullet$] {\bf Other Indexable Things} should also be indexed.
  If the thing is a constant variable, a constant-like macro, or an enum
  constant, index it using \verb&\idx[Constant]{thing}&.  If the thing is
  a function-like macro, index it using \verb&\idx{thing}& (which is equivalent
  to \verb&\idx[Function]{thing}&).  If it is a macro that is non-function-like
  and non-constant-like then index it using \verb&\idx[Macro]{thing}&.  If the
  thing is a variable (including function-like variables) then index it using
  \verb&\idx[Variable]{thing}&.  If the thing is a concept, then just use the
  standard \LaTeX\ command \verb&\index{thing}&.
\end{itemize}


\chapter{Package {\texttt {samplepackage}}}
\label{c:SamplePackage}

An introductory description of what is in the package.
There is no specific length limit, but $O[1]$ page seems
reasonable. Note the naming conventions for packages: all lower case.


\newpage

\section{Header {\texttt {SampleHeader1.h}}}
Put a one sentence description of the header right after the section
heading.

\subsection*{Synopsis and description}

\begin{verbatim}
#include "SampleHeader1.h"
\end{verbatim}
Since it is possible that a few modules will use the same header file
you can put a general description of what is to come here, and save
more specific comments for the module and function documentation.

\subsection*{Error conditions}
To insure that these are current with the code, a table of {\bf these
must be automatically extracted from the source code with the {\tt
laldoc} auto-documenter.} Additional explanation (if necessary) of the
error conditions can follow the table.

\subsection*{Structures}

The LAL-Spec encourages the use of LAL datatypes whenever possible,
but, if you must use  non-LAL structures, they must be documented
here.  They must also be included in the index with a
\verb@\index{sampleStruct}@ {\LaTeX} command.

\vfill{
\footnotesize{
\vspace{-1ex}
\mbox{}\marginpar{\tiny\texttt{l.1}\\\texttt{SampleHeader1.h}}
\vspace{-3ex}
\begin{verbatim}
Author: Hacker, A. Good
$Id$
\end{verbatim}
}
}

\newpage

\subsection{Module {\texttt {SampleModule1.c}}}
Put a one sentence description explaining what this module will do.
[Also, start a new page for documenting each module.]

\subsection*{Prototypes}
{\bf Function prototypes must be extracted verbatim from
the source code and ``{\verb@\input{}@}" here.}

\noindent
{\bf Every function must be placed into the index with
a \verb@\index{SampleFunction()}@ {\LaTeX} command.}

The LAL-Spec encourages modularization: ``{\it Small} sets of {\it
related} functions may grouped together into a single file.''
[Emphasis added.] Therefore, if the list of prototypes gets too long

\chapter*{References}

This should be a stand-alone bibliography for the references used in
this package only.  We recognize there may be entries that are
repeated in other packages and there are more clever ways to do this,
but this seems to be the simplest.

\chapter*{Index}
The index for the Package {\tt samplepackage} should start on a new
page.  The \verb@\printindex@ command should be in the {\tt main.tex}
file, because we only want this index to appear in the stand-alone
documentation for this package.  When we the comprehensive
documentation is built, only the all-encompassing index will appear
at the end of the entire document.

\part{LALDoc: Automated Documentation}

\chapter{The automatic documentation system}
\label{c:laldoc}

We will first describe the code parser that sifts through the source
code and extracts the parts that are to be incorporated into the
documentation. Then we describe how the documentation is automatically
built when the LAL is installed.

\section{A four step introduction to the code parser {\texttt {laldoc}}}

\noindent
These four-step instructions are also outlined in the file
{\tt /lal/doc/laldoc/README}.

\begin{itemize}
\item[(1)] Copy the executable ({\tt /lal/doc/laldoc/laldoc})
and the  sample input file ({\tt /lal/doc/laldoc/LalDocDemo.h}) to an
empty  {\tt /home/alice/junk} directory.
\item[(2)] In {\tt /home/alice/junk}
run the command ``\verb@./laldoc LalDocDemo.h Errors.out@''
\item[(3)] {\LaTeX} the file {\texttt {LalDocDemo\_LaTeX\_This\_File.tex}}.
\item[(4)] Read the  document created in step 3
({\texttt {LalDocDemo\_LaTeX\_This\_File.dvi}}) . It will explain how
the various debris files were created from the original source file
and how they were input to make the document.  If you follow your
nose,  you will see exactly what  {\texttt {laldoc}} does and how it
works.  Also, make sure you look at the file {\tt Errors.out}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Brief Description of the parser {\texttt {laldoc}} }

The purpose of the auto-documentation procedure we are using with the
LAL is to adhere the common wisdom: ``keep the documentation close to
the code''.  The system is built around a a code
parser {\tt laldoc} that allows LAL programmers automatically extract fragments of
code or comments from the source files and include them in their
documentation.  This is done in such a way that if the fragment in the
source code is modified, then the change is automatically incorporated
into the documentation the next time the document is built.

This extraction is  accomplished by having the programmer surround the
fragments of code or comments he or she wishes to incorporate in the
document with key-words.  Currently, we only have three pairs of
key-words, so the learning curve is flat and short! The source code
(the .c and .h files) is then parsed and the fragments written to
storage files.  (The key-word also includes a space for user-specified file name
where the fragment will be stored.)  When you write your documentation simply
use the {\LaTeX} command \verb@\input{}@ to put the contents of the
storage file in the document where you need it.

When you install the LAL on your machine, the parser is automatically
run on all {\tt .c} and {\tt .h} files. The extracted files are
stuffed into the directory {\tt lal/doc/autodoc/}.  If you have
installed the LAL software package, take a look at the contents of
{\tt lal/doc/autodoc/}. Their are dozens of extracted files their.

\subsection{ The {\texttt {laldoc}} command line }
The full functionality of the command line is:
\begin{verbatim}
     laldoc inputFile.c errorFile /home/alice/errorDir/ /home/alice/inputDir/
\end{verbatim}
\noindent
The zeroth command line argument is the executable itself.
The first argument is the input file name, the second is an error reporting
file, the third argument is the directory where the error file will be
written, and the fourth is the directory where {\tt laldoc} will look
for the input file.  The third and the fourth arguments are optional.


\subsection{ The three {\texttt {laldoc}} environments }

One general comment about the  {\texttt {laldoc}} environments:
None of the text on the line with the opening key-word or on the
line with the closing key-word will be extracted.

\begin{description}
\item[$\bullet$ ]
The verbatim environment is opened key-word
{\verb@<lalVerbatim file="myVerbatimJunk">@}  and closed with the key-word
{\verb@</lalVerbatim>@}. The material between the two key-words will
be wrapped in a {\LaTeX} {\tt verbatim} environment for later
inclusion.  This is useful for including such things as a function
prototypes or data structures: they will appear ``verbatim'' in the
documentation.  When the information is included with {\tt
<lalVerbatim>} {\tt laldoc} supplies a small {\tt marginpar} gives the
source-file name and line number where the snippet came from.
\vspace*{-0.05in}
\item[$\bullet$ ]
The {\LaTeX} environment is opened and closed with the key-words
{\verb@<lalLaTeX file="myLatexJunk">@}  and {\verb@</lalLaTeX>@}. This is
used to write {\LaTeX} in the source-code. The material between the two
key-words is stored in a file {\tt myLatexJunk.tex}.  This allows (not
recommended) a programmer to put large sections of {\LaTeX} prose in the
source code.
\vspace*{-0.05in}
\item[$\bullet$ ]
The error-table environment.  There is a special environment for
translating the source code that assign the error codes and messages
directly into a {\LaTeX} table. All you need to do is wrap the code
between the key-words {\verb@<lalErrTable file="myErrTabJunk">@} and
{\verb@</lalErrTable>@}.  This insures that if an error code is added
in the source, it will automatically be added to the documentation.
\vspace*{-0.051in}
\end{description}

\subsection{ How {\texttt {laldoc}} handles the output files}

{\bf Default file names:} In any of the {\texttt {laldoc}} environments,
if you do not specify an output file in the opening key-word line,
{\texttt {laldoc}} will assign one automatically. The file name will
be constructed from the input file name, e.g. if the input
is  {\tt MyHeader.h}, the default output will be {\tt MyHeaderH.tex}.

{\bf Appending to files:}
If the output file doesn't already exist, {\texttt {laldoc}} will
create it.  If the output file already exists, {\texttt {laldoc}} will
append to it.  When the environment-closing key-word is encountered,
the output file is closed.

Although this is a fairly obvious feature, it is quite useful.  For
example, the function prototypes in a module don't appear together in
the source, but they should appear together in the documentation.
With {\texttt {laldoc}} this is easy to accomplish. In your source
code when you encounter each prototype that must be captured for
inclusion, use the same file name for the extraction, i.e surround
each prototype with
the pair {\verb@<lalVerbatim file="MyModuleCPrototypes">@}  and
{\verb@</lalVerbatim>@}.  Each prototype will be appended to the file
{\tt MyModuleCPrototypes.tex}, and separate margin pars will tell
exactly where each came from.





\section{Examples of how to use the three environments in {\texttt {laldoc}} }

As with most things computer, the best way to learn how use the auto
documenter is to snoop around the source tree and find some examples,
and then try a few things.  The source code and the executable for the
parser ({\tt laldoc}), are in the directory {\tt lal/doc/laldoc}.  The
directory also has a README file that give some nuts-n-bolts
instructions on how to use the parser.  This sections gives the basics
of what you can do.


\subsection{The {\texttt {<lalVerbatim>} }  environment }

As an example, look at the code fragment in the source file
\texttt{lal/packages/tdfilter/src/CreateZPGFilter.c}.

\begin{verbatim}
    /* <lalVerbatim file="CreateZPGFilterCP"> */
    void CreateCOMPLEX8ZPGFilter(LALStatus          *stat,
                                 COMPLEX8ZPGFilter **output,
                                 INT4              numZeros,
                                 INT4              numPoles)
    /* </lalVerbatim> */
\end{verbatim}
When {\tt laldoc} parses the source file, it produces the following
output in the file {\tt CreateZPGFilterCP.tex}

\begin{verbatim}

\vspace{-1ex}
\mbox{}\marginpar{\tiny\texttt{l.51}\\\texttt{CreateZPGFilter.c}}
\vspace{-3ex}
(backslash)begin{verbatim}
void CreateCOMPLEX8ZPGFilter(LALStatus         *stat,
                             COMPLEX8ZPGFilter **output,
                             INT4              numZeros,
                             INT4              numPoles)
(backslash)end{verbatim}
\end{verbatim}

This is then included in the {\LaTeX} documentation with an
\verb@\input{CreateZPGFilterCP}@ command, yielding the following
output:

\vspace{-1ex}
\mbox{}\marginpar{\tiny\texttt{l.51}\\\texttt{CreateZPGFilter.c}}
\vspace{-3ex}
\begin{verbatim}
void CreateCOMPLEX8ZPGFilter(LALStatus         *stat,
                             COMPLEX8ZPGFilter **output,
                             INT4              numZeros,
                             INT4              numPoles)
\end{verbatim}

The {\tt marginpar} on the far right tells the line number and file
name where the fragment came from.

{\bf Note the naming convention used for the file where the extracted
code was stored: the base name comes from the file where it was
extracted (here {\texttt {CreateZPGFilter}}), followed by a ``C'' (in
this case to denote that it came from the .c file).  {\Large {Use This
Naming Convention!}} This will avoid most name-space collisions.}  In
this case,  the the ``P'' is for function {\it prototype}.


\subsection{The {\texttt {<lalLaTeX>} } environment }

The {\texttt {<lalLaTeX>} } environment works much the same
was as the {\texttt {<lalVerbatim>} } environment. The distinction
being that the extracted material should be valid {\LaTeX} ready
for insertion into a {\LaTeX} file.

In the {\texttt {<lalLaTeX>}} environment, leading ``*'''s on a line
will be stripped out by {\tt laldoc}. This is to accommodate the common
practice in c of putting leading ``*'''s on comment lines.  The way
this is done is {\tt laldoc} checks to see if the first non blank
character on the line is a ``*''. If it is, then it is replaced by
blank when the line is written to the output file. The leading
blanks are ignored when the file is {\LaTeX}ed.


\subsection{The {\texttt {<lalErrTable>} } environment, for printing
a table of the error codes and warnings.}

See the example in Chapter \ref{c:CodingNotes}.


\section{How the documentation is automatically built}

Some of the documentation (perhaps most of it)  for a package is in
the source files awaiting extraction.  The rest of the documentation
for the package is in the {\tt lal/packages/mypackage/doc/} directory.
How does it all get pulled together to make a coherent document?  The
short version of the explanation is that all the necessary files
either exist in, or are copied to, or are linked to the directory {\tt
lal/doc/autodoc/}, then {\LaTeX} is run in the {\tt autodoc/} directory
and important results are moved back.  You can see the specifics of
how this happens (and how to modify it for your own use) if you examine
the contents of the {\tt Makefile.am}'s in the various {\tt doc/}
directories.

When  you type {\tt make dvi} during the installation, a chain of
events takes place. First, the {\tt laldoc} parser is run in each
source directory ({\tt src}, {\tt include} and {\tt test}) in all the
packages.  The documentation snippets are culled out of the source
files and stuffed into files in {\tt /lal/doc/autodoc} directory. When
this is complete, the stand-alone documentation is built one directory
at time.  First, links from the {\tt .tex}, {\tt .eps} and {\tt .pdf}
files to the {\tt autodoc} directory are established.  Then the {\tt
main.tex} file is copied from the package's  {\tt /doc} directory to
the {\tt autodoc} directory. Then {\tt main.tex} is {\LaTeX}ed
(actually, we run {\tt pdflatex}). When this is complete, {\tt
main.pdf}  and {\tt main.tex} are moved back the package's {\tt doc}
directories.  This is repeated for each package.

After the documentation for the individual packages is built, then the
comprehensive documentation is built in essentially the same way.  The
file {\tt /lal/doc/lsd.tex} is copied to the {\tt autodoc} directory
and {\LaTeX}  ({\tt pdflatex}) is run on it. Then  {\tt lsd.tex} and
{\tt lsd.pdf} are moved back to the {\tt doc} directory.
