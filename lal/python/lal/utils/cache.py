class CacheEntry(object):
    """
    A Python object representing one line in a LAL cache file.

    The LAL cache format is defined elsewhere, and what follows is meant
    only to be informative, not an official specification.  Each line in a
    LAL cache identifies a single file, and the line consists of five
    columns of white-space delimited text.

    The first column, "observatory", generally stores the name of an
    observatory site or one or more instruments (preferably delimited by
    ",", but often there is no delimiter between instrument names in which
    case they should be 2 characters each).

    The second column, "description", stores a short string tag that is
    usually all capitals with "_" separating components, in the style of
    the description part of the LIGO-Virgo frame filename format.

    The third and fourth columns store the start time and duration in GPS
    seconds of the interval spanned by the file identified by the cache
    line.  When the file does not start on an integer second or its
    duration is not an integer number of seconds, the conventions of the
    LIGO-Virgo frame filename format apply.

    The fifth (last) column stores the file's URL.

    The values for these columns are stored in the .observatory,
    .description, .segment and .url attributes of instances of this class,
    respectively.  The .segment attribute stores a igwn_segments.segment
    object describing the interval spanned by the file.  Any of these
    attributes except the URL is allowed to be None.

    Example (parse a string):

    >>> c = CacheEntry("H1 S5 815901601 576.5 file://localhost/home/kipp/tmp/1/H1-815901601-576.xml")
    >>> c.scheme
    'file'
    >>> c.host
    'localhost'

    Example (one-liners to read and write a cache file):

    >>> import os
    >>> filename = "874000000-20000.cache"
    >>> # adjustment for doctest in out-of-tree builds
    >>> inname = os.path.join(os.environ.get("LAL_TEST_SRCDIR", "."), filename)
    >>> # one-liner to read
    >>> cache = list(map(CacheEntry, open(inname)))
    >>> # one-liner to write
    >>> print(*cache, sep = "\\n", file = open(filename + ".new", "w"))

    Example (extract segmentlist dictionary from LAL cache):

    >>> import igwn_segments as segments
    >>> seglists = segments.segmentlistdict()
    >>> for cacheentry in cache:
    ...    seglists |= cacheentry.segmentlistdict
    ...

    NOTE:  the CacheEntry type defines a comparison operation and a
    .__hash__() implementation, both of which disregard the URL.  That is,
    if two CacheEntry objects differ only by URL and otherwise have same
    metadata, they are considered to be redundant copies of the same data.
    For example, uniquification with a set() will retain only one redundant
    copy, selected at random.

    >>> x = CacheEntry("H1 S5 815901601 576.5 file://localhost/home/kipp/tmp/1/H1-815901601-576.xml")
    >>> y = CacheEntry("H1 S5 815901601 576.5 gsiftp://data.server.org/bigpileofdata/H1-815901601-576.xml")
    >>> x == y
    True
    >>> len(set((x, y)))
    1

    NOTE:  this is a pure Python object providing an alternative
    representation of the contents of a LAL cache file to the C
    implementation in the LAL library proper.  The two are not
    interchangeable.
