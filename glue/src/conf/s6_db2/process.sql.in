CREATE TABLE process
(
-- This table contains information about a specific invocation of a program.

-- Database which created this entry
-- For example, 1 is lho, 2 is llo, 3 is cit
------------------ primary key1 -------------------------
      creator_db         INTEGER NOT NULL WITH DEFAULT 1,

-- BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROGRAM
-- Program name
      program            VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
-- Version of the program
      version            VARCHAR(64),

      cvs_entry_time     INTEGER,
-- User comment which describes the program
      comment            VARCHAR(255),

-- INFORMATION ABOUT THIS INVOCATION OF THE PROGRAM
-- Flag to indicate whether it was run on-line (1) or off-line (0)
      is_online          INTEGER NOT NULL WITH DEFAULT 0,
-- Node on which it was run
      node               VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,

-- Parameter set identifier.  Permits an association between multiple
-- invocations of a program which use the same set of input parameters.
-- Probably not filled initially (because of timing issues if multiple
-- processes start at about the same time), but updated later.
      param_set          INTEGER,

-- INFORMATION ABOUT THE DATA HANDLED BY THIS PROGRAM
-- Interferometer(s) from which data comes.  In general, a process
-- knows in advance what interferometer's data it is analyzing.
-- (This is necessary to retrieve frameset metadata, for instance.)
-- Make this variable long enough to indicate multiple interferometers.
-- (e.g. "H1H2L1G1V1T1")

-- We constrain only on enforcing unique process_id and creator_db.
-- If two processes have the same process metadata, it is up to the
-- user to resolve this. Under condor we cannot enforce uniqueness
-- of start_time or node (since two processes may start on the same
-- dual cpu machine at the same time), unix_procid (since the value
-- returned by getpid() is invalid in the condor standard universe:
-- a checkpointed job may have multiple pids) and jobid (since the 
-- condor equaivalent of cluster.process is not guaranteed to be 
-- unique. If the condor history is deleted, it will reset to zero)
