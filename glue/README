GLUE: Grid LSC User Environment

Glue is a collection of utilities for running data analysis pipelines
for online and offline analysis as well as accessing various grid
utilities.  It also provides the infrastructure for the segment
database.

The Glue web site:

   http://www.lsc-group.phys.uwm.edu/daswg/projects/glue.html

contains many useful links for Glue users and developers.

If you have questions or comments about Glue, please send them to the
lal-discuss mailing list. You may join this list at: There are two
LALApps mail lists/archives which are shared with LAL. These are:

This README file explains how to build and install Glue.

If you use GLUE in published scientific work, we request that you
include a reference in your work as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Determine your Python version

Python version 2.4 or greater is required to install Glue. Type:

  python -V

to determine the version of python installed on your machine. For
example:

  [duncan@contra lalapps]$ python -V
  Python 2.4.3

If you do not have version 2.4 or greater installed, contact your system
administrator for help installing Python.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Get Glue from Git

Glue is part of the LALSuite Git repository. First choose a directory in
which to install the LALSuite sources. In this example, we install the
sources into ${HOME}/src. If you decide to install somewhere else,
change ${HOME}/src to the directory you have chosen. Change
albert.einstein in the git clone below to your ligo.org kerberos
principle, if you have one. Type:

  mkdir -p ${HOME}/src
  cd ${HOME}/src
  git clone git+ssh://albert.einstein@ligo-vcs.phys.uwm.edu/usr/local/git/lalsuite.git

If you do not have a ligo.org kerberos principle you can get the source
code anonymously using:

  git clone git://ligo-vcs.phys.uwm.edu/lalsuite.git

This will create a directory ${HOME}/src/lalsuite containing the
LALSuite sources.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Build and Install Glue

Choose a location in which to install Glue. In this example we choose
/opt/glue. You must have write access to this directory, so you may wish
to install in ${HOME}, for example. Set the environment variable
${GLUE_LOCATION} to point to your chosen install directory. Bash or sh
users should type:

  export GLUE_LOCATION=/opt/glue

and csh users should type:

  setenv GLUE_LOCATION /opt/glue

Assuming you have installed the glue sources in ${HOME}/src/glue, type:

  cd ${HOME}/src/lalsuite/glue
  ${PYTHON} setup.py install --prefix=${GLUE_LOCATION}

This will build and install all the glue modules and programs.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Set up your Environment for Using Glue

If you are a bash or sh user, edit your .profile (or .bash_profile) file
and add the lines (changing /opt/glue to wherever you installed Glue):

  export GLUE_LOCATION=/opt/glue
  if [ -f ${GLUE_LOCATION}/etc/glue-user-env.sh ] ; then
    source ${GLUE_LOCATION}/etc/glue-user-env.sh
  fi

If you are a csh user, edit your .login file and add the lines (changing
/opt/glue to wherever you installed Glue):

  setenv GLUE_LOCATION /opt/glue
  if ( -f ${GLUE_LOCATION}/etc/glue-user-env.csh ) then
    source ${GLUE_LOCATION}/etc/glue-user-env.csh
  endif

Now log out and log back in to ensure that all environment variables
have been updated.

You may now use Glue! Please report any problems via the Gnats database
linked from the Glue home page.
